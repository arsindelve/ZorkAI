    I’ve always loved Infocom games. Their unique blend of storytelling, humor, and puzzles is something I’ve cherished
    for years. For younger generations who didn’t grow up with text-based games and might not understand the appeal of
    solving puzzles without flashy graphics, these classics can feel like a relic of the past. I wanted to find a way to
    honor the legacy of these games, and introduce them to a new generation of players. How could I make these games
    feel richer, deeper, and more alive? The answer was clear: generative AI.

    While fully AI-generated dungeons and interactive fiction exist, that wasn’t what I wanted. I wasn’t looking to
    create new games—I wanted to preserve everything that makes Zork iconic: its settings, story, humor, and puzzles.
    But I also wanted to use AI to enhance the experience. My goal was to create an intelligent text parser and a
    “smart” narrator—one that understands everything you type. If your command advances the story or changes the state
    of the game, the original narrative remains intact. If not, the AI Narrator responds in a meaningful, often humorous
    way to keep you immersed in the Great Underground Empire. This could be a fantastic way for a new generation to
    discover and enjoy the magic of these timeless adventures.

    So, I built it.

    I hope you enjoy it, and I’d love to hear what you think
