    I LOVED Infocom games. In my youth, they gave me hours of entertainment, and began my love of personal computing. I
    still collect and play the games, but I wanted to do something to enhance and expand those games for a new
    generation of players. What could I do to make those games feel richer, deeper and more alive?

    Although there are fully AI generated dungeons and interactive fiction stories, that wasn't what I was looking for.
    I don't want NEW games; I want to preserve all the settings, locations, story, humor and puzzles of Zork, but use AI
    to make the interactivity much deeper. I want an intelligent text parser, and a "smart" narrator that understands
    everything you type. If your command moves the story forward, or changes the state of the game, then I want to
    preserve the original story. If not, the AI Narrator should give you a meaningful, funny response that keeps you
    immersed in the Great Underground Empire.

    I've written a brand new Interactive Fiction Engine in C#, with corresponding C# game files for the first
    approximately 50% of Zork I. Ideally, this engine could be used to implement any first-generation
    Infocom game with minimal or no tweaking.

    This a full game....yet. But it does demonstrate that this can work, and can have
    truly excellent results! (Thanks mostly to how good GPT4 is). I'll keep implementing the rest of the Zork I story,
    items and location, finding new scenarios that the engine can't handle but the game is quite playable in its
    current state.
