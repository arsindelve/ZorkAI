        YOU too can make BIG MONEY in the exciting field of PAPER SHUFFLING!

        Mr. Anderson of Muddle, Mass. says: "Before I took this course I was a lowly bit twiddler. Now with what I learned at GUE Tech I feel really important and can obfuscate and confuse with the best."

        Dr. Blank had this to say: "Ten short days ago all I could look forward to was a dead-end job as a doctor. Now I have a promising future and make really big Zorkmids."

        GUE Tech can't promise these fantastic results to everyone. But when you earn your degree from GUE Tech, your future will be brighter.
