// I initially misinterpreted the function of the yellow and brown buttons, so the dam stumped me for a while.
// Pushing them doesn't lead to any immediately obvious effects, they just respond with a "click".  To see their
// effects you need to go back out to the dam controls and notice that the "small green plastic bubble" begins to
// glow when you push yellow (any number of times), and stops glowing when you push brown.
// 
// It all seems very simple in retrospect, but making this connection took a while.  There is a bolt on the dam
// controls, and it will only turn if the green plastic bubble is glowing.  I can't tell you how many combinations
// of items I tried to use on this bolt before realizing the connection with the green plastic bubble.  Once
// the green plastic bubble is glowing, you can turn the bolt with the wrench.
