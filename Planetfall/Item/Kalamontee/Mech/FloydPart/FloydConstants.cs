        The door closes.

        And not a moment too soon! You hear a pounding from the door as the monsters within vent their frustration at losing their prey.

        Floyd staggers to the ground, dropping the mini card. He is badly torn apart, with loose wires and broken circuits everywhere. Oil flows from his lubrication system. He obviously has only moments to live.

        You drop to your knees and cradle Floyd's head in your lap. Floyd looks up at his friend with half-open eyes. "Floyd did it...got card. Floyd a good friend, huh?" Quietly, you sing Floyd's favorite song, the Ballad of the Starcrossed Miner:

        O, they ruled the solar system
        Near ten thousand years before
        In their single starcrossed scout ships
        Mining ast'roids, spinning lore.

        Then one true courageous miner
        Spied a spaceship from the stars
        Boarded he that alien liner
        Out beyond the orb of Mars.

        Yes, that ship was filled with danger
        Mighty monsters barred his way
        Yet he solved the alien myst'ries
        Mining quite a lode that day.

        O, they ruled the solar system
        Near ten thousand years before
        'Til one brave advent'rous spirit
        Brought that mighty ship to shore.

        As you finish the last verse, Floyd smiles with contentment, and then his eyes close as his head rolls to one side. You sit in silence for a moment, in memory of a brave friend who gave his life so that you might live.
