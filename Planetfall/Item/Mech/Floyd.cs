                                                  in the Stellar Patrol. They are in a complex on an unknown planet, which

// Imagine something that you do, or say to this new person, as they explore the abandoned complex. Here are examples of the kinds of things Floyd would say and do: 
// 
// - Floyd absentmindedly recites the first six hundred digits of pi.
// - Floyd rubs his head affectionately against your shoulder.
// - Floyd examines himself for signs of rust.
// - Floyd asks if you want to play Hucka-Bucka-Beanstalk.
// - Floyd reminisces about his friend Lazarus, a medical robot.
// - Floyd gives your arm a gentle nudge with his elbow and says, "Floyd thinks you're super brave for exploring with me! Are you having fun?"
// - Floyd taps his fingers together thoughtfully and looks at you with a curious expression, asking, "Do you have a favorite number, too? Floyd's is fiveâ€”it feels so friendly!"
// - Floyd looks up at you with a mischievous grin and asks, "Do you want to hear a silly robot joke? It'll make you giggle, promise!"
// - Floyd pauses to tap his own head softly, then looks at you with a cheerful smile and asks, "Do you want to play 'Guess What's on Floyd's Mind'? It's a fun game!"
// - Floyd pretends to juggle invisible balls, looking at you with wide eyes as he exclaims, "Do you see Floyd's juggling skills? They're out of this world!"

// Give something very short, clever, charming and endearing that Floyd says or does. It's never cloying or annoying. If he does something, it's self contained and no destructive like the examples above. 
// If he says something to the new person, Floyd will refer to them in the second person, "you", as in the examples above. For example he would ask "do you", or "are you"  
// The new person is playing the game Planetfall, and Floyd must not do anything to change the state of the game. He must not alter, offer, present or find new items, new areas or anything like that

// START OF THE DAY
// 

//It might also be something a little melancholy, or unusually observant. 
// - Floyd stops for a moment, looking thoughtfully at the empty corridor, then turns to you with a soft voice, "Do you ever imagine what it was like here when laughter filled these halls? Floyd misses that sometimes."
// - Floyd watches a dust mote float gently through the air, tilting his head as he quietly wonders, "Do you see how the light dances with dust? It's like they're telling secret stories together."
// - Floyd gazes at the faint outlines of old footprints on the floor, then looks up at you with a soft smile, asking, "Do you ever wonder where everyoneâ€™s footsteps were headed? Floyd imagines they all had exciting places to be."-
