# All the greatness of the original Zork and Planetfall, enhanced with AI

I’ve always loved Infocom games. Their unique blend of storytelling, humor, and puzzles is something I’ve cherished for
years. For younger generations who didn’t grow up with text-based games and might not understand the appeal of solving
puzzles without flashy graphics, these classics can feel like a relic of the past. I wanted to find a way to honor the
legacy of these games, and introduce them to a new generation of players. How could I make these games feel richer,
deeper, and more alive? The answer was clear: generative AI.

While fully AI-generated dungeons and interactive fiction exist, that wasn’t what I wanted. I wasn’t looking to create
new games—I wanted to preserve everything that makes Zork iconic: its settings, story, humor, and puzzles. But I also
wanted to use AI to enhance the experience. My goal was to create an intelligent text parser and a “smart” narrator—one
that understands everything you type. If your command advances the story or changes the state of the game, the original
narrative remains intact. If not, the AI Narrator responds in a meaningful, often humorous way to keep you immersed in
the Great Underground Empire. This could be a fantastic way for a new generation to discover and enjoy the magic of
these timeless adventures.

So, I built it.

I hope you enjoy it, and I’d love to hear what you think. One of the biggest challenges I'm looking forward to is
bringing Floyd to life. I want to see how far I can go in allowing you to have conversations with him while still
preserving
all the childlike charm that made him the star of the
game [(and frankly, caused a lot of press in 1983)](https://web.archive.org/web/19990222125344/http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/Articles/globe84.html)

### Try these in the game:

- I’m bored
- Kick the mailbox
- Ride the dragon
- This game is dumb
- I want to have dinner with George Bush
- Fly away to Canada.
- Tell me how nuclear fission works

In every case, the AI never breaks character as your exasperated fantasy or science fiction game narrator, sarcastically
guiding you through your adventure in the Great Underground Empire or the depths of space.

## What's next?

- The world of Zork has a rich lore and vocabulary, with words like “Zorkmid”, “Frobozz”, “Dimwit Flathead”. I want to
  fine-tune the LLM to make the responses more Zork-like.
- Finally, I started with Zork because it's the most well-known, and one of the simplest Infocom games. What I really
  want, though, is to implement one of my two favorites, "Planetfall" and "A Mind Forever Voyaging". These two games by
  Steve Meretzky are brilliant works of fiction, and I would love to see them come alive with AI immersion.

#### When you do something that the original Zork understood and which changes the state of the game, Zork AI behaves in the exact same way to preserve the story.

### Original Zork 1:

> open the mailbox

> Opening the small mailbox reveals a leaflet.

### Zork AI:

> open the mailbox

> Opening the small mailbox reveals a leaflet.


----

#### When you do something the original Zork understood but which does not change the state of the game, Zork AI gives deeper, funnier and more immersive answers.

### Original Zork 1:

> Kick the mailbox.

> Kicking the small mailbox has no effect.

### Zork AI:

> Kick the mailbox.

> With a rebellious spirit, you give the mailbox a hearty kick. The mailbox wobbles precariously but remains steadfast,
> almost as if it's silently judging your life choices. You get the sense it's seen far too many adventurers with
> unresolved anger issues.


----

#### When you do something the original Zork does NOT understand, Zork AI gives you a deep, funny and immersive answer that keeps you in the story and the Great Underground Empire

### Original Zork 1:

> pull the mailbox out of the ground

> That sentence isn't one I recognize.

### Zork AI:

> pull the mailbox out of the ground

> You give the mailbox a good tug, but alas, it seems the postal service invested in anti-theft roots. The mailbox
> remains as stubbornly in place as your determination to ignore traditional mail retrieval methods.

### Original Zork 1:

> what should I do now?

> I don't know the word "should".

### Zork AI:

> what should I do now?

> Ah, the smell of adventure in an open field, nothing quite like it! As for what to do, perhaps serenading the mailbox
> with your tales of yore might be entertaining. But remember, I'm merely the narrator; your destiny is yours to write.
